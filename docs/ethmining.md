#Ethereum Mining

From Turin, Italy with <3

##Test Environment

    - Intel i5 CPU
    - 12Gb ram
    - Nvidia GTX 770 [driver 352.79 - openCL 1.2]
    - 500W power supply
    - Ubuntu 14.04 - 64bit

##Nvidia driver setup

    - find out the model of your graphics card:
      $ sudo lspci -vnn | grep -i VGA -A 12

    - check your graphic card drivers:
      http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx

    - add xorg-edgers ppa that provides very latest nvidia
      drivers:
      $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa -y
      $ sudo apt-get update

    - grab your drivers with:
      $ sudo apt-get install nvidia-352

##Nvidia cuda toolkit setup

    - download cuda drivers:
      https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
      select Linux, x86_64, Ubuntu, 14_04 and Deb(local)

    - move to your download folder:
      $ sudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu1404_7.5-18_amd64.deb
      $ sudo apt-get update
      $ sudo apt-get install cuda

    - reboot the system

##Geth setup

If you want to mine in solo.

Geth is used to insert your machine as a node in the ethereum network.
You will be able to create a new account (wallet) and contribute with Ethminer software in the transaction validation process

    - you need a good editor and git installed on your system
      $ sudo apt-get install vim
      $ sudo apt-get install git

    - move to your desktop and create a folder:
      $ mkdir go-ethereum
      $ cd go-ethereum
      $ git clone https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum
      $ sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libgmp3-dev golang

    - add some tunning
      $ export GO_OPENCL=true
      $ export GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT=95

    - compile geth
      $ cd go-ethereum
      $ make geth

    - if everything goes well try in the same folder
      $ build/bin/geth gpuinfo
      and you will be able to see your graphic card infos

##Ethminer setup

    - sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ethereum/ethereum-qt
      sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ethereum/ethereum
      sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ethereum/ethereum-dev
      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install cpp-ethereum

##Managing accounts

Your account is the place where you will be rewarded for your contribution in the transaction validation process.

You can create an account ("wallet") in different ways locally with geth or with third part services like an amazing Google Chrome extension called jaxx.

Those will provide you an address that you will use to mine, because the reward has to be store somewhere.

Locally

    - move to: $ cd ~/Desktop/go-ethereum/go-ethereum
      and: $ ~/Desktop/go-ethereum/go-ethereum build/bin/geth account new

##Commands

Set of useful commands

    - move to: $ cd ~/Desktop/go-ethereum/go-ethereum
      and start the geth console:
      $ ~/Desktop/go-ethereum/go-ethereum build/bin/geth --fast (starting up your local node and blockchain sync)

    - open a new terminal tab $ cd ~/Desktop/go-ethereum/go-ethereum build/bin/geth attach (opening in a
      new tab the geth console)

In the geth console

    - > web3.eth.coinbase (checking your account address)
    - > web3.fromWei(eth.getBalance(eth.coinbase), "ether") (check your wallet balance)

If you started the local node with geth in a new terminal tab you can start mining in solo mode with ethminer

    - $ ethminer -G -M (gpu benchmark, not require geth running)
    - $ ethminer -G (start only when geth --fast console print out that the sync has been finish)

To start pool mining (that means to attach your hash rate to other people and have also partials reward)

    - ethminer -G -F
      http://eth1.nanopool.org:8888/yourAddress/nameOfYourMiner/yourEmailForGetNotifications
      (not requiere geth running)



##Utils

Could be a good idea signing up in a crypto currency exchange on the internet so you can change your ethereum reward in bitcoin or $, â‚¬, etc.
